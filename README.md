# RaodAccExcel
This is a project I learnt from youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeWfLNe3moM

In this tutorial, I learnt how to gather the data, data cleaning, proccesing, analysis and create the interactive dashboard all in Excel.

Data used in this tutorial is data from wikipedia about Reported Road Casualties Great Britain. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reported_Road_Casualties_Great_Britain

From the interactive dashboard, we can conclude that:
- Total reported road casualties in Great Britain are 417887.
- Total casualties reported in Great Britain for Fatal, serious and slight severity is 7135, 59312 and 351436 respectively.
- Car accident caused highest casualties with total amount of 333485 casualties where Agriculture vehicle, bus, van, motorcycle and others respectively contribute  1032, 12798, 33472, 33672 and 3424 to number of reported road casualties in Great Britain.
